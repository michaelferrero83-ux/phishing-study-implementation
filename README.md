# Phishing research: browser traffic and website signals

Current repository: **[michaelferrero83-ux/phishing-study-implementation](https://github.com/michaelferrero83-ux/phishing-study-implementation)**. This is a separate repository with the original project history. Use this repository for new clones, issues and pull requests. References to Lawrken in imported documents and frozen assignment owners retain their original identities.

This project visits frozen PhiUSIIL dataset endpoints inside a disposable Ubuntu VM, records browser traffic and website measurements, and preserves both successful captures and failed visits. Chromium renders the page; Playwright controls it and records request/response events. Python also measures DNS and input-origin certificate metadata.

**Start with [the two-laptop assignment plan](docs/TWO_LAPTOP_PLAN.md) and [the AI handoff](docs/AI_DATASET_HANDOFF.md).** The full dataset assignments are prepared, but the current operator does not ingest them yet. Its existing Run command still selects the original shared 400-record reserve. Do not use it on both laptops expecting the new assignments to apply.

**Setup is a prerelease:** fresh Ubuntu/SSH/Python preparation succeeded, but the pinned Chromium download timed out. See [measured release status](docs/RELEASE_VALIDATION.md). The supported operator host is Windows x64 with QEMU/WHPX. VirtualBox and a Linux desktop are not needed for this route.

## Clone and prepare

The source repository is public. Obtain the frozen `study-inputs-v1.zip` privately from the project owner; raw assignment files are also sent directly. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) and [64-bit Python 3.12 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Windows OpenSSH Client, firmware virtualization and Windows Hypervisor Platform must be available. GitHub CLI is optional. Setup does not change Windows features or security settings.

In PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/michaelferrero83-ux/phishing-study-implementation.git
cd phishing-study-implementation
.\host-tools\ResearchOperator.ps1 -Mode Inspect
.\host-tools\SetupResearch.ps1 -Region 'YOUR ACTUAL CITY, COUNTRY' -InputsArchive 'PATH\study-inputs-v1.zip'
```

Replace the location with the actual collection location and the input path with the privately supplied ZIP. Setup verifies that input archive and downloads checksum-pinned QEMU and Ubuntu files. It creates new SSH identities and attempts to install the pinned Python/Chromium environment inside Ubuntu, then powers off the VM. It does not visit dataset websites. Allow several GB of downloads/installation space and time for the first setup. The unresolved Chromium installation failure is documented above.

Startup requires **5 GiB available Windows RAM and 50 GiB free disk**; 16 GB installed RAM or more is recommended. The VM receives 4 GiB RAM and two CPUs. The collector has one worker, a 2 GiB limit and a separate DNS-service budget.

## Verify, then run

First verify this computer without dataset visits:

```powershell
.\host-tools\ResearchOperator.ps1 -Mode Run -MaxAttempts 10 -VerifyOnly
```

If that passes, start a bounded batch:

```powershell
.\host-tools\ResearchOperator.ps1 -Mode Run -MaxAttempts 10
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8766/** while the run is active. It shows Ubuntu startup, verification, the actual Chromium page when loading succeeds, real traffic events, saved signals and visit outcomes. A DNS failure cannot show a loaded page; it is recorded and the queue continues. The monitor closes when the command ends.

From a second PowerShell window:

```powershell
.\host-tools\ResearchOperator.ps1 -Mode Status
.\host-tools\ResearchOperator.ps1 -Mode Stop
```

After a successful batch and verified export, advance beyond all attempted URLs, including failed visits:

```powershell
.\host-tools\ResearchOperator.ps1 -Mode Run -MaxAttempts 10 -Continue
.\host-tools\ResearchOperator.ps1 -Mode Report
```

Each batch reruns verification. Ten attempts may yield fewer than ten usable captures. The chain retains the frozen reserve's 400-attempt ceiling. A verification-only run is not a collection batch and cannot be the starting point for `-Continue`.

In Command Prompt (`C:\...>`), use `host-tools\ResearchOperator.cmd` in place of `.\host-tools\ResearchOperator.ps1`.

## Understand the evidence

- The published labels are historical: `0=phishing`, `1=legitimate`. A successful capture does not independently establish the current page's class or active phishing status.
- Live visits are passive. Controlled interaction is fixture-only. No credentials are supplied, forms intentionally submitted or models retrained by this operator.
- `local-dataset-observation-v1` requires local kernel/firewall, browser, DNS logging, lifecycle and cleanup checks. It performs no Vercel control visit and makes no owned-site Internet verification or full public-verification approval claim.
- Fresh VM overlays, source/configuration identities, failures, DNS logs, redacted browser events, SQLite records and hash-verified exports go under `phishing-study/validation/operator-.../` on each computer. These are excluded from Git.
- The original study's balanced 150 captures (75 per published class) remain on the owner's computer. They are not silently copied into a friend's new results. Changing websites need not produce the same availability or measurements on another day or network.

The original training/validation/test membership and input hashes are frozen in the release manifest. Reserve selection uses seed `20261010`, training groups only, one endpoint per homogeneous domain/tenant group, without selecting by reachability or model predictions.

For changes, fork the repository and submit a pull request; no collaborator write access is needed. Keep raw observations, VM disks and credentials out of Git. Read [replication and evidence limits](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md), [troubleshooting](docs/FRIEND_SETUP.md#troubleshooting) and [third-party attribution](THIRD_PARTY.md). Fresh deployment verification is mandatory on every collection host; a passing CI run or setup receipt is not deployment approval.
